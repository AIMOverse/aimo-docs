# Authentication

## Generate Your API Key

To access the AiMo Network LLM API, you need to generate an API key through our web dashboard:

1. Visit the [AiMo Network Dashboard](https://aimo.network/account/keys)
2. Click "Generate API Key"
3. Copy your API key - it will start with `aimo-sk-v2-`

**Example API Key Format:**
```
aimo-sk-v2-[base58-encoded-key]
```

:::warning
Store your API key securely. It cannot be retrieved again after generation. Never expose API keys in client-side code or public repositories.

## API Key Management

### Security Best Practices

1. **Keep Keys Secure**: Store API keys securely, never expose them in client-side code
2. **Use Environment Variables**: Store keys in environment variables or secure configuration
3. **Rotate Keys Regularly**: Generate new keys periodically for enhanced security
4. **Monitor Usage**: Track your API key usage and costs through the dashboard

### Key Revocation

If your API key is compromised, you can revoke it immediately through the web dashboard:

1. Go to the [API Keys](https://aimo.network/account/keys) section
2. Find the compromised key
3. Click "Revoke" to disable it
4. Generate a new key to replace it

### Key Management

- **View all keys**: See all your active API keys in the dashboard
- **Track usage**: Monitor request counts and spending per key
- **Delete keys**: Remove keys you no longer need
